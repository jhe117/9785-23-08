UC Capstone Project - Electricity Demand Forecasting Use Machine Learning

Electricity generation is one of the most important inventions in human history. Electricity powers devices in our homes, transportation, and factories. Predicting the electricity demand is essential for power generation and investment decisions so that costly problems, such as shortage and oversupply, are avoided. The project aims to build machine learning algorithms to predict the future consumption of electricity. The project aims to implement machine learning algorithms in Python to predict electricity demands based on historical usage data.
